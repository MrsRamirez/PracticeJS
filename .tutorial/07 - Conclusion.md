# Conclusion

Well, that's it! You now know the basics of JavaScript! You can do some pretty cool stuff, however there's plenty more to learn. Want to learn more? With any luck, I'll be making more tutorials which are a little more advanced. I'm planning on making a simple web game development with JavaScript tutorial.

If you enjoyed this tutorial, found it helpful or learned something new from it, let me know in the comments! I'd love to see what you create with what you've learnt!

Want to challenge yourself? Try completing the challenges in the `Challenges` folder in the file hierarchy! To check a challenge, press 'run', then in the webview, click on the button that says 'Challenge' and the number signifying which challenge you are completing.
