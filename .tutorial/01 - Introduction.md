# Introduction

Hi, welcome to my JavaScript tutorial!

Throughout this tutorial you will learn the basics of JavaScript, an essential programming language for web development (many parts of this _somewhat_ interactive tutorial are actually made with JavaScript!).

In this tutorial, we'll look at data types, variables, logic, loops and functions. If you ever want to learn more, two great places to start your search are [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp).

Well? What are you waiting for? Jump right in!
